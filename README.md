# Carlos Ray Segarra Portfolio Project
## Goal of Website
For my project, I will develop a portfolio website to discuss my qualifications, showcase my prior experiences, and 
visually represent my talents. This portfolio aims to highlight the skills I gained through my time at NJIT and my 
previous work experiences for future employers. What I outline should not be a copy and paste of my resume but rather 
an extension and visual representation of the skills gained. Additionally, it will establish my online presence with 
employers, making it easy to google my name.
## Target of Website
As previously stated, my intended audience is future employers. Therefore, this website will be relevant to those 
seeking to hire me. The information presented will concern what skills I can bring to the table. 
## Topics of Website
My portfolio will pertain to my professional career in information technology. An “About Me” section will describe 
who I am and what I do. This is where potential employers can learn more about me and connect with me. Next, my 
website will include relevant education, coursework, project, and a downloadable resume. Finally, there will be a 
section with all of my most up-to-date contact information and social media links.
## Call to Action
After reading the content on my webpage, employers, my intended audience, should have a good understanding of who I am 
and the skills I have to offer. The ultimate goal of the website is to give them all the information they need to go 
ahead and consider whether I am fit for their company. If so, they have all the information they need to contact 
me.
