        2018 to 2020 <h3> <i>Project Assistant</i> </h3>
        </h2>
        <p>At New Jersey Innovation Institute, I refined my skills in organizing and maintaining projects. I was a
        part of the Promoting Interoperability team under NJII's healthcare division. The PI Team oversaw the
        incentives for medical practices in New Jersey implementing and using electronic healthcare records. In
        doing so, practices help promote EHR interoperability --think cross-play between different video game
        hardware. As such, my experience there consisted of working collaboratively on specific short- and long-term
         projects. I oversaw tasks delegated to me by my project manager, coordinated with all necessary vendors and
          service providers, and ensured that projects were moving forward on time.</p>
